%
% scaletta:
%
% Many papers (quote: Morelli & de G\:otzen, others) outline the birth of an
% evolution of service design from the paradigms of expert design and (?
% reread) to that of diffuse design (Manzini) in which co-design (designer
% designs along with the user or accepts the participation of the end--user to
% the value creation process.
%
% Several analyses are presented - but no analysis under a critical philosophy
% approach seems to be carried out by anyone (however: quote Hillgren's work
% which seems to get near to this).
%
% Co-design raises many problems in terms not only of authorship and control.
% It raises them also in terms of moral, ethical and esthetical frameworks --
% which all belong to philosophy and ultimately also to critical philosophy.
%
% Critical philosophy is itself in bad shape after Bauman et al.
%
% Outline of the moral, ethical and aesthetical problem.
%
% Cases
%
% The IKEA case: IKEA makes money targeting on lower-middle class young
% couples, while excluding other less ``co--creative'' groups (such as
% lower-middle class elderly people). The idea is that it replaces part of the
% workforce it would have to retribuire with people actually doing the work
% for IKEA and \emph{also} paying to do it. It achieves its goals through the
% means of compliant skilled designers which amenage products so that they
% meet their targets. And the IKEA firm accumulates huge profits on it because
% it wins on all sides, while users win only in gaining access to lower--cost
% second--quality furniture. (A word on the immense selection -> Bauman's
% freedom).
%
% Facebook vs. Wikipedia
%
% Facebook is designed to produce anti-democratic noise, Wikipedia is an
% attempt to reduce noise and produce culture.

% Google and OpenData
